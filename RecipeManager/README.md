### The Recipe Manager is the final project of the Python Essentials Course.
This project consolidates the fundamental concepts learned throughout the course.
The Recipe Manager allows users to add, view, search, edit, and delete recipes.
It's not strictly a tool to manage recipies but it's an application to manage burgers by
adding various ingredients.
